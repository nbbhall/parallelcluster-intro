**High Performance Computing (HPC) - Intro**

HPC is the ability to perform parallel data processing to improve computing performance and perform complex calculations at high speeds

Its popular applications include AI/ML, trend analysis, test simulation, etc

HPC typically requires
- A cluster of co-located multi-node compute
- High network bandwidth
- Shared storage


**HPC on Cloud v/s HPC on-premise**

on-demand, virtually infinite compute capacity

Elasticity â€“ scale up and down as required; pay only for what you use

Choice of infrastructure (Spot, On-demand, Graviton, C5n)


**Why ParallelCluster?**

Provides ease of HPC cluster management (through text based configuration files)

Provides automatic compute resource scaling (on-demand or spot)

Automatic shared storage scaling (using EFS or FSx)

Ease of migration from on-premise (slurm job scheduler)

Ease of integration with other AWS services

# High Performance Computing (HPC) - Intro

HPC is the ability to perform **parallel** data processing to **improve computing performance** and **perform complex calculations** at high speeds

It's popular applications include AI/ML, trend analysis, test simulation, etc

## HPC typically has
- A cluster of co-located multi-node compute (CPU, GPU, RAM)
- High network bandwidth
- Shared storage
- job orchestration engine (scheduler)

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## HPC on Cloud v/s HPC on-premise

- on-demand, virtually infinite compute capacity
- Elasticity – scale up and down as required; pay only for what you use
- Choice of infrastructure (Spot, On-demand, Graviton, C5n)

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Why ParallelCluster?

- Provides ease of HPC cluster provisioning and management (through text based configuration files)
- Provides automatic compute resource scaling (on-demand or spot)
- Automatic shared storage scaling (using EFS or FSx)
- Ease of migration from on-premise (slurm job scheduler)
- Ease of integration with other AWS services
- Open source

## Architecture

- client (pcluster)
- head node
- compute node
- job scheduler
- EFS / FSx for Lusture (shared FS)

## User Workflow 

![](workflow.png)

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Main Components

- job scheduler (slurm or awsbatch)
- head node
- compute nodes
- EFA
- EFS / FSx for Lusture (shared file system between master and compute nodes)

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Other Components - clustermgtd (Slurm only)

- Syncs scheduler with EC2 status
- Static capacity management (ensure required number of EC2 are up)
- Unhealthy Amazon EC2 instances management
- Unhealthy Scheduler nodes management

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Other Components - computemgtd (Slurm only) 

- compute management daemon running on each compute node
- Syncs with head node every 5 mins
- Shuts down if it cannot reach head node

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Other Components – nodewatcher (both slurm and awabatch) 

- Runs on each node in the compute fleet
- monitors node and scales down if 
    - no job on instance for more than 10 mins (scaledown_idletime)
AND
    - no pending jobs

## Out of scope
- code troubleshooting
- code support
- only infrastructure is supported
